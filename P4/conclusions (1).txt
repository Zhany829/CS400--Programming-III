My hashtable is better because it has less counts than Java's Tree Map, which means my hashtable can take less time to run
2) What did you observe in jdk mission control to come to the conclusion above?
I observe the counts number for my classes in JDK
3) SCREENSHOT_001.PNG NOTES: Briefly describe what this image 001 shows
It shows the counts number for hashtable and treeMap
4) SCREENSHOT_002.PNG NOTES: Briefly describe what this image 002 shows
it shows the overall information, like CPU usage
5) Describe other screenshots if you include them in your submission.
